# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This project is the backend half of the WTWR project! Created using:

- Node.js
- express
- mongoDB

This project contains routes and controllers. They are used to get, create, and delete items on the front end of WTWR. This project also stores user data in the server which allows users to create an account. The requests were tested using postman to make sure they were being used appropriately.
